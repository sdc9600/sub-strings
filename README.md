# sub-strings

Program aims to find the number of sub-strings that are found in a dictionary based on the users input of a string.

The program checks each word of the string against the dictionary (a hash) and increments 1 to the value of found words.

When the program is complete it returns a hash containing all of the keys and values of the dictionary hash when the value is greater than or equal to 1.
